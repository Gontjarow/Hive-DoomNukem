Hot fixed! Static ints were f'ing with us.

On the map called animfreeze, you can kill the enemies on the first room.
Move to the next room where u find 3 rangers
Shoot each ranger a bit, then kill one of them.
Proceed to kill another one and once u kill the third, its animation will prob freeze for a few seconds.
Sometimes its the second guy that freezes...

Animfreeze starts after replaying the map
